        <p>
            Hello, My name is Gbadebo Ajayi, a proud student at AltSchool. I'm passionate about coding and reading, I love movies also and basketball and love to learn. Here's a bit about me: I'm 30 years old, Nigerian, and a student of AltSchool. I used to be a UI designer but I've decided to change career paths and become a full-stack engineer. I'm hoping to learn a lot during this journey by the time I'm done with the program.

        <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
        <p>
            I chose to join AltSchool because it is one of the best engineering schools that offer quality teaching to people. I had a scholarship with Altschool from the Obokun Scholarship, and I hope to take advantage of this to hone my skills in programming towards my goal of being a full-stack engineer.
